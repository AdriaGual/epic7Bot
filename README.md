## Installation

This document is for the latest Epic7Bot version.

### Python 3

In order to run the bots from Epic7Bot you'll need to install Python, currently using version 3.8.11 but you can try another one (except Python 2 or older versions).

### NOX configuration

If you want to use the Epic7Bot you'll need to install NOX and put the path of the installed emulator on the config.py file.

`path = 'yourDrive:\\PathToNox\\Nox64\\bin'`

## Bot modules

Epic7Bot counts with various start bot modes.

### Bot

This is the mode you'll usually use, it basically gets the pet reward, goes to sanctuary, gets the dogs and queues 3 more dogs, does 5 arena NPC fights, does 1 altar fight, gets the daily rewards, gets the mail rewards and goes to do wyvern 11.

### Hunt

As the mode says, you chose a hunt stage in the game and the bot repeats the fight until you ran out of stamina.

### Replay stage

Similar to Hunt, basically repeats a normal stage.

### Upgrade 2 star fooders

Useful when you ran out of hero storage, just pick 2 star hero filter and this will merge all 2 star fooders into 3 star ones.

## Extra notes

### Language

The bot only works in spanish, if you want to run it in another language, you can override the pictures on the ´images´ folder with the corresponding ones.
